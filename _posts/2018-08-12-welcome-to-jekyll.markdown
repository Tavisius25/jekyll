This beings a journey on learning Bayesian statistics. Motivated by working to understand advancements in the field of machine learning through recent papers and lectures, this blog serves as a log along my journey to understanding many of the underpinning statistical concepts in modern predictive models. Here I will present the definitions and theorems as well as work to advance my understanding through derivations and practical demonstrations. I hope to provide both worked out solutions to problems and code for computational tasks. All code will be in either R or Python and detailed documentation of configuring your environment will proceed any programming task. I am consulting three excellent resources on Bayesian statistics and inference. `David J.C. MacKay's Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms`, `Allen B. Downey's Think Bayes`, and `Bayesian Data Analysis by Gelman et al.` I will pull definitions, theorems, and guiding principles from these textbooks, but my objective is to write clearly and without jargon. After all, Bayesian statistics and the larger space of machine learning are aimed at being interpretable. I will update this blog every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Working from definitions, to simple models, and finally more complex functions we will build up our confidence and our competency. Let the journey begin!
